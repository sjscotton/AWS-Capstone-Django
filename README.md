## Do I Vote
This web app is designed to increase voter participation and nurture positive habits around voting. A users who logs in can see their voting frequency and their voting streak along with analytics of how their records compare with people in their city and their age group.

All voter information is public information obtained from Washington state government. 

There will also be an option to share their streak on social media to encourage others to vote more as well. To help make voting easier the app will get all of the users elected representatives from local to federal government with contact info to assist people who want to get more involved. 

### Database 

This project uses a Postgres database that would need to be configured seperatly. Any other SQL based Databases should also work as well
